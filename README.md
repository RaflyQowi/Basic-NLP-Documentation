# NLP Documentation

Welcome to the NLP Documentation repository! This is your go-to guide for practical Python code in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It covers various text preprocessing techniques and machine learning applications based on my NLP learnings. The repository consists of two main folders:

## 1. Text Preprocessing 1

- **Tokenization:** Breaking down text into individual tokens.
- **Stemming:** Reducing words to their base or root form.
- **Lemmatization:** Reducing words to their base or dictionary form.
- **Stopwords:** Removing common stopwords from text.
- **Named Entity Recognition:** Identifying and classifying named entities in text.
- **Part of Speech:** Implementing part-of-speech tagging for grammatical categorization.

## 2. Text Preprocessing 2

- **Bag of Words:** Introduction to the Bag of Words model for text representation.
- **Bag of N-gram:** Implementation of Bag of N-grams for capturing local word patterns.
- **TF-IDF:** Explanation and implementation of the TF-IDF method for text feature extraction.

### Machine Learning Implementations

- **Spam or Ham Detection:** Utilizing the Bag of Words model for spam or ham classification.
- **News Classification:** Applying Bag of N-grams for classifying news articles.
- **E-commerce Product Classification:** Using TF-IDF for classifying e-commerce products.

## 3. Text Preprocessing 3

- **Word2Vec:** Implementing Word2Vec using the Gensim library for feature extraction on text.

### Machine Learning Implementations

- **Star Review Classification:** Using Word2Vec for predicting user star reviews based on their text reviews. Utilizing both a custom Word2Vec model and a pretrained model from the Gensim library.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RaflyQowi/Basic-NLP-Documentation.git
   ```

2. Explore the folders and run the Python files to understand and implement NLP techniques and machine learning models.

Feel free to adapt the code for your NLP projects or use it as a learning resource. If you have any questions or suggestions, please open an issue or reach out.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
