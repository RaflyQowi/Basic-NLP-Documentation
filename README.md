# NLP Documentation

Welcome to the NLP Documentation repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to practical Python code for Natural Language Processing (NLP). It contains implementations of various text preprocessing techniques and machine learning applications based on what I've learned about NLP. Currently, the repository includes two main folders:

## 1. Text Preprocessing 1

### Tokenization
Code for breaking down text into individual tokens.

### Stemming
Implementation of stemming techniques to reduce words to their base or root form.

### Lemmatization
Code demonstrating lemmatization for reducing words to their base or dictionary form.

### Stopwords
Examples of removing common stopwords from text.

### Named Entity Recognition
Code related to identifying and classifying named entities in text.

### Part of Speech
Implementation of part-of-speech tagging for identifying grammatical categories of words.

## 2. Text Preprocessing 2

### Bag of Words
Introduction to the Bag of Words model for text representation.

### Bag of N-gram
Implementation of Bag of N-grams for capturing local word patterns.

### TF-IDF
Explanation and implementation of the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method for text feature extraction.

### Machine Learning Implementations

#### Spam or Ham Detection
Utilizing the Bag of Words model for spam or ham classification.

#### News Classification
Applying Bag of N-grams for classifying news articles.

#### E-commerce Product Classification
Using TF-IDF for classifying e-commerce products.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/NLP-Documentation.git
   ```

2. Explore the folders and run the Python files to understand and implement NLP techniques and machine learning models.

Feel free to adapt the code for your NLP projects or use it as a learning resource. If you have any questions or suggestions, please open an issue or reach out.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
